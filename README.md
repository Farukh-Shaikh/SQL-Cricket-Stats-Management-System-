# SQL-Cricket-Stats-Management-System-

The project entails creating a database which stores the statistical data of all the cricket players whether on international or national teams. It will have all the players worldwide who have been recognized as professional players in cricket. 
Furthermore, it will also include all the records of the players such as their total score or what matches has been played internationally or nationally. We will also try to implement the project using blockchain technology(not certain). 
The database will include multiple tables as well as give the user to enter or retrieve data as well as edit any existing data, following the restrictions that will be placed on the database so any unnecessary information or invalid information shows up in the database.
